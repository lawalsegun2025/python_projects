## 1. JPG to PNG Image Converter

<p align="justify">
  
  This python script takes to arguments, the first is the path to the folder containing all the `.jpg` images you will like to convert to `.png` format. The second argument is the path to the folder you will like to save the converted image(s).

  The script grabs the first two arguments, then it checks if the second argument (which is the path to the folder where to save the converted images) exists, if not, it creates the folder. Then it loops through the images in the first argument, converts the images to `.png` and saves it in the location of the second argument.
